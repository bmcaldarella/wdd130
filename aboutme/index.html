        Hi, I'm Bran 👋🏼 <br>  I'm 27 years old, I'm originally from Argentina, currently, I'm residing in Ireland.
        <br> I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ since my childhood,
        
        I had the opportunity to serve my mission in Brazil in 2014, it was undoubtedly an enriching experience.
        <br>Three years ago, I got married, and although we don't have children yet, we are excited about the future.
        <br>My great passion is technology and programming. I hope to enhance my skills in this course
        and continue learning, as I believe in the importance of ongoing education in this ever-evolving field.<br>
        I look forward to learning from each other and enjoying this course together!
